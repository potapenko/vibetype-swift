Before writing code, read the current project's `AGENTS.md`,
`BACKLOG_DEVELOPMENT.md`, `SWIFT.md` when Swift code is involved, and the
relevant existing spec.

If the requested change affects user-visible behavior:

1. update or create the spec first
2. implement against that spec
3. update verification artifacts if the project requires them

For menu bar, microphone, OpenAI transcription, permissions, external-service,
Keychain, clipboard, auto-paste, or text handoff work, resolve product behavior
before choosing implementation details.

Keep the spec short and product-level.

Do not rely on ad hoc chat memory as the source of truth for feature behavior.
